Role Name
========

Oracle Jdk ansible role. Completely independent from package manager, so you can use it on any linux distribution. It doesn't require root or sudo permission to run.

Requirements
------------

wget (a no brainer on modern Linux distributions)

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

none

Example Playbook
-------------------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: all
      roles:
         - { role: alexanderjardim.oracle_jdk }
